        <h2>Service-Level Agreement (SLA) Guarantees</h2>
        <p>Before beginning to work on the project, we sign a service-level agreement (SLA) that ensures there is no room for confusion regarding the services that need to be delivered at a specific date. This makes us aware of clientâ€™s exact expectations and to set in stone such aspects of the services provided as quality, availability and the responsibilities of both parties involved. At the same time the SLA agreement guarantees that the client receives the full range of features that were set forth during the stages of business analysis & project evaluation.</p>
